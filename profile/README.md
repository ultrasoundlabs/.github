**Welcome!** We're *Ultrasound Labs*, a team of developers specializing in building ultrasound solutions that matter most for today's Web3. We're based in Georgia 🇬🇪

# Ultrasound Vision

The key to reach mass adoption is to build solutions that:
- *User-first:* ...ordinary users need and will need most.
- *Simple:* ...need no previous experience in Web3.
- *Trustless:* ...prefer the crypto approach. Aggressively utilizing *ZK-MPC-FHE-TEE-whatever* is infinitely better than *a centralized, rent-seeking [SPOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure)*.
- *Borderless:* ...don't care who you are and where you are. Discrimination is and must stay Web2's disease.
- ***Ultrasound:*** ...work much, much **better** than today's alternatives.

# Our Projects

### [Untron](https://x.com/untronfi)

- [Untron V3](https://github.com/ultrasoundlabs/untron-v3/) — Horizontally scalable cross-chain liquidity protocol for Tron and EVM that uses an onchain Tron light client [(Hook, 2024)](https://ethresear.ch/t/p2p-zk-light-client-bridge-between-tron-and-ethereum-l2s/19931) for trustless swaps between chains. It supports swaps from any coin on Tron into any coin on 20+ EVM chains, orders $10m+ in size with smart routing, liquidity provision, and permanent deposit addresses. The entire infrastructure of Untron V3 is open-source and self-hostable in a one-click Dockerized setup.
- [Untron Intents](https://github.com/ultrasoundlabs/untron-intents/) - Intent-based framework for provably performing transactions on Tron from other EVM chains on-demand, based on Untron V3's trustless stack. Used for rapid & dust cheap swaps from EVM chains into Tron.
- [Untron V2](https://github.com/ultrasoundlabs/untron-v2/) — Legacy P2P protocol for swaps from Tron to Base. It had been running for over 9 months with zero hacks and losses, performed ~3k swaps over $600k in volume, and helped over 10 teams in crypto untron their users.
- [Untron Interface] — open-source and self-hostable UIs for the Untron project's protocols and solutions.
