**Welcome!** We're *Ultrasound Labs*, a team of developers specializing in building ultrasound solutions that matter most for today's Web3. We're based and registered in Georgia ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡ª

# Ultrasound Vision

The key to reach mass adoption is to build solutions that:
- *User-first:* ...ordinary users need and will need most.
- *Simple:* ...need no previous experience in Web3.
- *Trustless:* ...prefer the crypto approach. Aggressively utilizing *ZK-MPC-FHE-TEE-ADHD-whatever* is infinitely better than *a centralized, rent-seeking [SPOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure)*.
- *Borderless:* ...don't care who you are and where you are. Discrimination is and must stay Web2's disease.
- ***Ultrasound:*** ...work much, much **better** than today's alternatives.
