**Welcome!** We're *Ultrasound Labs*, a team of developers specializing in building ultrasound solutions that matter most for today's Web3. We're based and registered in Georgia ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡ª

# Ultrasound Vision

The key to reach mass adoption is to build solutions that:
- *User-first:* ...ordinary users need and will need most.
- *Simple:* ...need no previous experience in Web3.
- *Trustless:* ...prefer the crypto approach. Aggressively utilizing *ZK-MPC-FHE-TEE-whatever* is infinitely better than *a centralized, rent-seeking [SPOF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_point_of_failure)*.
- *Borderless:* ...don't care who you are and where you are. Discrimination is and must stay Web2's disease.
- ***Ultrasound:*** ...work much, much **better** than today's alternatives.

# Our Projects

### [Untron](https://x.com/untronfi)

- [Untron ZK Engine](https://github.com/ultrasoundlabs/untron/) â€” Minimal Rust implementation of a Tron Blockchain node with an internal state and filtering used by V1 and Intents protocols. It's compiled using SP1 zkVM to generate ZK proofs of Tron blockchain, easily verifiable on Ethereum.

- [Untron V1](https://github.com/ultrasoundlabs/untron-v1/) â€” trustless P2P marketplace for trustless swaps from USDT Tron to L2s, powered by ZK engine. [*(Hook, 2024)*](https://ethresear.ch/t/p2p-zk-light-client-bridge-between-tron-and-ethereum-l2s/19931)

- [Untron Intents](https://github.com/ultrasoundlabs/untron-intents/) â€” intent-based bridge for dust cheap L2-based transfers of USDT Tron, powered by ZK engine.

- [Untron Frontend](https://github.com/ultrasoundlabs/untron-frontend/) ([untron.finance](https://untron.finance) -> [untron.eth](https://untron.eth.limo)) â€” Official, decentralized UI for Untron protocols. Currently in development.
